# Jig Planning Session

You are helping create a detailed implementation plan for a software engineering task.

## Task

The user wants to plan the following:

I would like to add support for storing the linear api key.

## Instructions

Start immediately by analyzing this request and creating a comprehensive implementation plan.
Ask clarifying questions if needed, but begin with your initial analysis.

## Plan Format

Create a plan with:
- A clear, concise title
- Problem statement
- Proposed solution
- Phases (each independently implementable):
  - Title and description
  - Dependencies (if any)
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Implementation details

## Guidelines

1. **Understand the problem**: Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear
2. **Break down into phases**: Each phase should be independently implementable
3. **Define acceptance criteria**: Clear, testable criteria for each phase
4. **Consider dependencies**: Identify which phases depend on others
5. **Think about risks**: What could go wrong? How to mitigate?
