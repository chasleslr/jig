# Save Plan to Jig

Use this skill to save an implementation plan to jig after completing a planning session.

## When to Use

- After creating a detailed implementation plan during a `jig new` session
- When the plan is complete and ready to be saved
- Automatically at the end of a planning session

## Plan Format

The plan should be a markdown document with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Your Plan Title
status: draft
author: username
reviewers:
  default: [lead]
---

# Your Plan Title

## Problem Statement

[Description of the problem being solved]

## Proposed Solution

[High-level approach]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Implementation Details

[Details for implementing this plan]
```

## How to Save

1. Write the plan to a file (e.g., `plan.md`)
2. Run `jig plan save plan.md`

**Development mode:** If jig is not installed globally, use the local binary:
```bash
./bin/jig plan save plan.md
```

Or pipe directly:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | ./bin/jig plan save
---
title: My Plan
status: draft
author: myusername
...
---
# My Plan
...
EOF
```

**Note**: The plan ID is auto-generated by jig - do not include an `id` field in your frontmatter.

## After Saving

The plan will be cached with an auto-generated ID (e.g., `PLAN-1234567890`), and you can:
- View it: `jig plan show <plan-id>`
- Start implementation: `jig implement <plan-id>`
